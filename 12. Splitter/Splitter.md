In chemical engineering, a splitter is used to divide a single process stream with same composition but different flow rates. 

Aim: develop a simple process flow sheet to split a given mass flow into equal proportions. 

Data: Fluid: Water,Inlet mass flow rate: 90 kg/h, Inlet Pressure: 1 bar, Temperature: 50 Â°C

Thermodynamic Package: Steam Table
