ChemSep is a column separator integrated with DWSIM, an open-source chemical process simulator, used for modelling distillation, absorption, and extraction operations. It is rigorous separation column model combines equilibrium stage and non-equilibrium. It supports the complex configurations like dividing wall column columns (DWC) and is CAPE-Open compliant. 

Aim: To simulate ChemSep Rigorous Separation column.
