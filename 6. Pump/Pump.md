A pump is a machine that moves liquid, gases or slurries from one place to another. It works by adding energy to the fluid, which creates pressure to push it through pipes or system. In chemical engineering plants, pumps are critical for transporting chemicals, water, slurries, or other fluids safely and efficiently.

Types of pumps used in Chemical Engineering Plants 

1. Centrifugal Pumps
What They Are: These are the most common pumps in chemical plants. They use a spinning part called an impeller to push fluid outward, creating pressure to move it.
How They Work: The fluid enters the center of the spinning impeller, gets flung outward, and is pushed into pipes.
Use in Chemical Plants: Used for moving large amounts of low-viscosity liquids like water, solvents, or dilute chemicals.
Examples: Transferring water, acids, or bases between tanks or reactors.
Why They’re Used: They’re simple, reliable, and good for handling large volumes of fluid.
Limitations: Not great for thick or sticky fluids (high viscosity) or very high-pressure needs.

2. Positive Displacement Pumps
What They Are: These pumps trap a fixed amount of fluid and push it out in precise amounts, making them great for controlled flow.
How They Work: They work like a syringe or piston, pulling in fluid and then forcing it out in small, consistent batches.
Types Used in Chemical Plants:
Diaphragm Pumps: Use a flexible membrane to push fluid. Great for handling corrosive or hazardous chemicals because the fluid doesn’t touch the pump’s moving parts.
Gear Pumps: Use rotating gears to move fluid. Good for thick liquids like oils or resins.
Peristaltic Pumps: Squeeze a flexible tube to move fluid, like squeezing toothpaste. Ideal for sterile or sensitive fluids because the fluid only touches the tube.
Piston/Plunger Pumps: Use a piston to push fluid, often for high-pressure applications.
Use in Chemical Plants: Pumping thick, viscous, or corrosive fluids, or when precise amounts of chemicals need to be added (e.g., dosing in reactors).
Why They’re Used: They handle tough fluids (corrosive, thick, or abrasive) and provide steady, controlled flow.
Limitations: More complex and expensive than centrifugal pumps, and not ideal for very high flow rates.

3. Magnetic Drive Pumps
•	What They Are: A special type of centrifugal or positive displacement pump that uses magnets to drive the impeller, so there’s no direct connection between the motor and the fluid.
•	How They Work: Magnets outside the pump spin magnets inside, moving the impeller without any seals that could leak.
•	Use in Chemical Plants: Used for hazardous or toxic chemicals (e.g., strong acids or solvents) to prevent leaks and ensure safety.
•	Why They’re Used: Leak-free, safe for dangerous fluids, and low maintenance.
•	Limitations: Can be expensive and not suitable for very high-pressure tasks.

4. Submersible Pumps
•	What They Are: Pumps designed to work while fully submerged in the fluid they’re pumping.
•	How They Work: The motor and pump are sealed to work underwater, pushing fluid to the surface.
•	Use in Chemical Plants: Used for pumping out wastewater, slurries, or chemicals from tanks or sumps (pits where liquids collect).
•	Why They’re Used: Great for deep or flooded areas, and they’re compact.
•	Limitations: Hard to maintain because they’re submerged, and not suitable for all chemicals.

5. Metering Pumps
•	What They Are: A type of positive displacement pump designed to deliver precise amounts of fluid at a controlled rate.
•	How They Work: They use pistons or diaphragms to push exact volumes of fluid, often with adjustable settings.
•	Use in Chemical Plants: Used for adding small, precise amounts of chemicals, like catalysts or additives, in processes like water treatment or chemical reactions.
•	Why They’re Used: Extremely accurate for dosing, reliable for small flows.
•	Limitations: Not suitable for large volumes or high-flow applications.

Aim: A small-scale industrial cooling system requires water to be pressurised from 2 bar to 5 bar to circulate through a heat exchanger network. The water enters the pump at a mass flow rate of 50 kg/h and a temperature of 50 C. The plant engineer needs to determine the power required by the pump to achieve this pressurization, ensuring efficient energy usage and proper equipment sizing. Simulate the process in DWSIM to calculate the pump power and verify the outlet conditions of the water stream.
