LMTD or Log Mean Temperature Difference, is a method used to calculate the average temperature difference between the hot and cold fluids in a heat exchanger. It represents the driving force for heat transfer. For heat exchanger, where one fluid enters at a higher temperature and exits cooler, and other enters cooler and exits warmer. The larger the LMTD more heat is transferred, and is introduced due to the fact that temperature change that takes place across the heat exchanger from the entrance to exit is not linear. 

Aim: Find the LMTD for the given configuration of heat exchangers.
