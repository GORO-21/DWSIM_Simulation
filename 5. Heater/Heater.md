Heat Duty refers to the amount of heat energy required or released by a system or process to achieve a specific temperature change, phase change, or to maintain a certain condition. It represents the rate of heat transfer needed for a process, such as heating, cooling, evaporation, or condensation.
It can be calculated by the formula:

Q=m⋅cp⋅ΔT (for sensible heat) 

Q=m⋅ΔH(for latent heat)

where: 

Q = Heat duty (energy/time)

 m = Mass flow rate (mass/time)

cp = Specific heat capacity (energy/mass•temperature)

ΔT = Temperature change

ΔH = Latent heat of phase change (e.g., vaporization or fusion)
Types: 

Sensible heat duty: Heat required to change the temperature of a substance without a phase change.

Latent heat duty: Heat required for a phase change (eg: liquid to gas) at constant temperature.

For example, in heat exchanger, the heat duty is the amount of heat transferred from the hot fluid to cold fluid per unit time to achieve the desired temperature change. 

Aim: Heating n-Hexane in a solvent Recovery Preheater
A chemical plant recovers n-hexane used as a solvent in an extraction process. The n-hexane mut be preheated from 25 C to 60 C before entering a distillation column for purification. Simulate this process in DWSIM to calculate the heat duty required for the heater.

Data: Mass flow rate (m): 8000kg/h, Inlet temperature: 25C, Outlet temperature: 60C, P: 2 bar
