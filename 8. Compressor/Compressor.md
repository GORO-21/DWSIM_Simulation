A compressor is a machine or device that squeezes air or gas into a smaller space, increasing its pressure. This makes the air or gas more powerful and useful for different task. 

How it works:

•	Sucks in air/gas: The compressor pulls in air from the surroundings

•	Compresses it: It uses mechanical parts (like pistons or blades) to squeeze the air into a smaller space.

•	Stores or delivers: The high-pressure air is either stored in a tank or sent to power tools, machine or other equipment’s.
