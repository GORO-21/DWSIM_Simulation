A turbine is a machine that converts the energy in a moving fluid into mechanical energy, which can be used to generate electricity or power other equipment. It uses steam or water to spin a rotor, this spinning drives generator or other machinery.

How turbine works:

Input energy: A high-pressure fluid (steam or gas) enters the turbine

Energy Conversion: The fluid’s energy pushes the blade, causing rotor to spin

Output: The spinning rotor drives a generator to produce electricity or power other equipment.

Exhaust: The fluid exits the turbine at lower pressure and temperature, having given some of its energy

Aim: A small scale industrial utilizes a steam turbine to generate power for its operations. The facility aims to evaluate the turbine’s performance under current operating conditions and explore opportunities for optimization to enhance the energy effieciency and reduce operational costs.
