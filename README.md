# DWSIM_Simulation

This repository contains a collection of process simulations created using DWSIM, an open-source process simulator for chemical engineering applications. Each simulation demonstrates various unit operations, thermodynamic models, and process configurations, providing practical examples for students, researchers, and engineers. The files include detailed flowsheets, input parameters, and results to facilitate learning, replication, and further development. Contributions, feedback, and additional simulations are welcome to enhance this growing resource for the DWSIM community.

Note: For the .dwxml file (simulation file), you can download it and run it directly in DWSIM simulation software.
