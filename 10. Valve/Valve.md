Valves are mechanical device used to control the flow, pressure, and direction of fluids within piping systems. 

Function of valves:

Flow Control: Regulate the rate of fluid flow (e.g., throttling or stopping flow).

Isolation: Completely stop flow to isolate equipment or sections for maintenance or safety.

Pressure Regulation: Maintain or adjust pressure within the system.

Direction Control: Direct fluid to specific pathways (e.g., diverting flow).

Safety: Prevent overpressure or hazardous leaks (e.g., relief valves).

Mixing or Diverting: Blend fluids or redirect them to different process units.

Aim: A chemical processing plat operates water distribution system to supply cooling water to various heat exchangers and reactors. The plant aims to simulate the valveâ€™s performance using DWSIM to ensure it meets process requirements and to explore optimization opportunities.
